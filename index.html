          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">In October 2020, during the COVID-19 quarantine, I stumbled upon the hobby of building 
            PCs, thanks to the abundance of free time. However, I first had to understand how a PC works before 
            building one. Within two weeks, I became an expert in the field, thanks to the online resources provided 
            by a popular Reddit community and a few YouTubers. Nonetheless, my biggest obstacles were the scarcity of 
            computer parts and the exorbitant price of the ones that were available. Despite the challenges, I 
            persevered and managed to obtain my desired hardware at great deals. With that said, let's jump right 
            into the details of my PC build.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">The CPU is one of the most crucial components of a computer, and selecting the right one is essential to ensure smooth and efficient performance. 
            The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 is a great choice, as it boasts a powerful 6-core, 12-thread configuration that can handle most applications with ease. Despite being a few 
            years old, it remains a popular option for many gamers and content creators. With its high clock speeds and excellent multi-threaded performance, it's well-suited 
            for handling demanding tasks like video rendering and streaming games at max settings. Plus, its low power consumption and thermal footprint make it an attractive 
            option for those looking to build a system with minimal noise and heat output. Overall, the Ryzen 5 3600 is a solid CPU that offers great value for its price and 
            should provide many years of reliable performance.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">When it comes to building a PC, choosing the right CPU cooler can make all the difference in keeping your system running smoothly. 
            The Wraith Stealth cooler is a great option, especially for those who don't need to push their system to the limit with intensive applications or 
            overclocking. This cooler is included with the CPU itself, so there's no need to purchase an additional one. It's a reliable and efficient cooler 
            that does a great job at keeping temperatures low, even under moderate workloads. Plus, since it comes with the CPU, it's a cost-effective option 
            that won't break the bank. Overall, the Wraith Stealth cooler is a solid choice for those who want a hassle-free, yet effective cooling solution.</p>

          <p class="mx-auto">The motherboard is like the brain of the computer. All of the different parts of the
            computer are connected
            to the motherboard.This lets them work together. Your CPU sits in the motherboard and all your external
            peripherals (Keyboard,Mouse,Ethetnet) connect. This motherboard has an AM4 socket which is compatible to
            Ryzen 5000, 3rd/2nd/1st Gen AMD Ryzen CPUs. I liked that it had two HDMI ports as well as a numch of USB
            ports.
            It also runs pretty fast. My only regret would be that it didn't come with in board WIFI.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">Memory, also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), is a type of computer hardware where information is temporarily stored for 
            immediate use by the computer's processor. In my PC build, I decided to go with the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB RAM kit, which comes with two sticks of 8GB each. 
            While I'll admit that the RGB lighting was the main factor that caught my attention, I also found that this memory kit offers good performance at a reasonable price point.
             With a clock speed of 3200 MHz, it runs fast and can handle multiple tasks at once without any issues. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my choice of RAM and would definitely 
             recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and aesthetically pleasing memory solution for their PC.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">Storage gives a computer the ability to retain data such as documents, photos, videos etc.
            I have two different forms
            of storage for my computer. The first one being the Seagate Barracuda external hard drive. I purposely chose
            for it to
            have 2TB because I knew Id be downloading a lot of games, apps and photos. I think its a great hard drive
            for the amount
            of storage and the price. It also runs fast. My second form of storage is the WD Blue SN550 SSD. This
            storage sits on the
            motherboard and has 500gb. The SSD is much quicker than the external hard drive. I only have my OS and a
            couple huge games
            that are normally known to take a while to load.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">The graphics card is what sends a video signal to your display. At the time of the
            pandemic, it was super hard to get the
            new 30 series card or any card for that matter because building a computer became a trend. And because it
            was so popular,
            everyone was buying everything, and prices were through the roof because of all the demand and very little
            product available.
            I chose the 2060 Super because I was looking for something that wouldnt phase out and would last a long time
            before needing an
            upgrade. I also wanted something super reliable because if I needed to have it replaced that would be a
            problem. The 2060 Super
            has 8gb of GDDR6 RAM and it still puts out a great picture when playing AAA games.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">When it comes to PC cases, there are a lot of options to choose from, but I decided to go with the H510 mid-tower case. 
            The clean, minimalistic design caught my eye and I knew it would look great on my desk. However, as I started to use it more, I noticed 
            that there wasn't as much ventilation as I would have liked. This is important because proper ventilation is necessary to keep all the 
            components cool and functioning properly. Despite this issue, I still think it's a great case for the price and I don't regret my decision. 
            In the future, I may end up swapping it out for a case with better ventilation, but for now, it serves its purpose and looks great while 
            doing it.</p>

            When I was first
            learning about computer components. One piece of advice for power supplies was to never cheap out on them
            because a bad one could fry your whole system and even catch on fire. I did a bunch of research and I kept
            coming back to Corsair for a good power supply brand. So, I got a 750 watt 80 plus gold power supply.
            Its very good for the price, quiet and has more than enough power.</p>
